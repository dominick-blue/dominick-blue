## Who Am I? 
I am an academically-focused 👨‍🎓 autodidact 📚 who enjoys blending academic theory with real-world 🌏 application. My interests lie in solving business problems with distributed systems. My long-term goal is to work on planet-scale systems 🌏. I have taken the personal challenge to operate my life in parallel by dual-enrolling in a BS + MS program (see below) while continuing to develop my experience working on real-world systems.
